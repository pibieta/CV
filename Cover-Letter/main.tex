The purpose of this letter is to express my interest in applying for the \textit{Insight Data Science Fellows Program} - Silicon Valley, which is advertised in your institutional website. I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Mathematical Physics - University of São Paulo USP, in São Paulo, Brazil. I currently work with Quantum Physics and Topological Phases of Matter and during my research years I have dealt with data from several sources which eventually started my curiosity, now passion, about Data Science. 

I believe that Data is starting to revolutionize the world as we know it, in particular Machine Learning techniques appear to have the potential to solve many problems that have big impact both in academia and society. My outgrown interest for Data Science and the way it rapidly grows made me decide to do the transition into a career in industry, where I think my analytic skills and abilities will be found of great value.

My decision of applying to this program has two main reasons: First, the very intention of the program is to help scientist make the transition into industry. Second, I am aware of my lack of real world related working experience. By the way the program is outlined, I am sure that it will certainly help me fill all the gaps needed to perform outstandingly on a industry related job.
